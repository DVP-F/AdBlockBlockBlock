This is a chrome extension I'm making because I'm done with Google block ad blockers on YouTube. This will likely be available on the Chrome Web Store when it's done.
Until then, please refrain from use, as it is likely not stable.

Aside from that, I probably won't care if you use this code for reference- It's not that crucial to me, I'm writing it in hate.

Any and all attributions should be made to; 
DVP, DVPF, DVPProto, Carnx, Carnx00, or other fair names, such as account names
